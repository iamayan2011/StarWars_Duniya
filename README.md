# Star Wars Duniya

Star Wars Duniya is a React Web App. It fetches data from Star Wars API (SWAPI). 

This project was a part of the assesment component of a company and was done in a limited time. So, only characters were fetched and displayed as of now.


The app has following features/operations:

* Single Page React Application
* Data fetched from SWAPI (Star Wars API)
* Pagination (as suggested by API)
* User can get more details by clicking on the "Show Details" button.
* Cards' color is based on the Species a particular character belong to. Colors are unique for each species and are not randomised (totally dependent on the species.)
* Modal color is same as that of the Card color.
* Animations.
